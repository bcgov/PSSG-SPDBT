# Dockerized Project

## Introduction

A helper script ([manage](./manage)) is provided to facilitate running the project in both production-like and development mode. To see the usage options, execute `./manage -h`.

### Pre-Requisites

- Docker
- A bash compatible shell (such as Git bash)

## Building the project

Before running the containers for the first time, as well as every time production-like mode is required, `./manage build` should be executed to build the containers.

## Running the project

The project can be run in `development` and `production` modes.

### Development mode

When starting the project using `./manage start-dev`, the `frontend` and `backend` services will run using a development server, with the source code mounted as a volume and hot-reloading enabled.

### Production mode

When starting the project using `./manage start`, all services will be started in production mode: this means code changes will require `./manage build` to be applied.

## SMTP Email

When running in localhost in development mode, open your browser at `http://localhost:1080` to see outgoing email messages generated by the system.

## Seeding the database

To seed the database with test data, execute `./manage seed` in a separate shell once all the backend services are running.

## Swagger Docs

Once the containers have started, go to `http://localhost:8384/swagger` if in development mode or `http://localhost:8484/swagger` if in production mode to access the SwaggerUI.

## Test users

Alternatively, ask the CMS team to invite and set-up appropriate permissions for your Azure AD account.

## Recommended configuration

If you have Windows 10 (PRO) use "Hyper-V" for virtualization instead of "WSL 2". In this way, it is easier to use “hot reload” in development environment. If you have to use "WSL 2", make sure to copy the source code project into the "WSL 2" file system to make "hot reload" work.Consider the following images as a reference for Docker configuration:
